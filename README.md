ASF Mass Config Editor is tool to edit same value in multiple json files for https://github.com/JustArchi/ArchiSteamFarm

You can select values which you want to change (curently only 6) and you can also select json files which you wanna ignore.

I am not sure if output data types in json files are correct so use at your own risk.

I am currently not providing binary files so if you want to use this app download nwjs from https://nwjs.io/ and extract files from this repository into nwjs directory.




And this my first atempt to use git and github so Keep Calm and git gud!
